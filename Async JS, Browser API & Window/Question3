The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) is a security measure implemented by web browsers to protect users from malicious websites attempting to access data from other websites without proper authorization. In the context of AJAX requests, the Same-Origin Policy restricts a web page from making requests to a different origin than the one from which the page was loaded. An "origin" is defined by the combination of the protocol, domain, and port. This means that if a web page loaded from https://example.com tries to make an AJAX request to https://api.example.com (even though it might be on the same domain), the browser will block this request because the origins are different. This restriction helps prevent a variety of security issues, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

However, there are scenarios where a web application legitimately needs to interact with resources from a different origin. To work around the Same-Origin Policy, several techniques can be employed. One common approach is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which allows servers to specify who can access their resources by including specific HTTP headers in their responses. When a browser detects that the server has sent the correct CORS headers, it allows the AJAX request to go through, even if the request is cross-origin. For instance, a server might include an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header with the value https://example.com, indicating that only requests from this origin are permitted.

Another way to bypass the Same-Origin Policy is by using a proxy server. In this approach, the client sends the request to a proxy server that resides on the same origin as the web application. The proxy server then forwards the request to the target resource on the different origin and relays the response back to the client. Since the client only communicates with the proxy server on the same origin, the browser does not block the request.

In the past, developers also used a technique known as JSONP (JSON with Padding) to work around the Same-Origin Policy. JSONP leverages the fact that <script> tags are not subject to the Same-Origin Policy. By dynamically adding a <script> tag to the page that points to a resource on a different origin, the browser will execute the script, which typically contains a JSON response wrapped in a function call. However, JSONP has limitations and security risks, so it has largely been replaced by CORS in modern web development.

Server-side rendering (SSR) is another approach to avoid issues with the Same-Origin Policy. In SSR, the server handles the cross-origin requests and then renders the response as part of the HTML sent to the client. Since the request is made by the server rather than the client, the Same-Origin Policy does not apply.
