Promises and callbacks are both mechanisms used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, but they differ significantly in how they manage these operations, making Promises generally preferred for a number of reasons.

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after an asynchronous operation completes. This pattern has been a fundamental part of JavaScript since its early days. While simple to implement, callbacks can become unwieldy when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations that need to be executed sequentially or in parallel. This often leads to a phenomenon known as "callback hell," where callbacks are nested within callbacks, creating code that is difficult to read, maintain, and debug. Moreover, error handling with callbacks can be cumbersome, as it often requires passing error objects through multiple levels of nested functions, making the code even more complex and error-prone.

Promises were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) to address the limitations of callbacks and provide a more structured approach to handling asynchronous operations. A Promise represents a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. It allows developers to write asynchronous code that is easier to read and maintain, using a chainable structure rather than deeply nested callbacks. A Promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. Once a Promise is fulfilled or rejected, it canâ€™t change its state, which simplifies the flow of asynchronous code.
